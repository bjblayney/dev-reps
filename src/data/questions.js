    question: 'What is the output of `typeof null` in JavaScript?',
    options: ["'null'", "'object'", "'undefined'", "'boolean'"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Due to a historical bug in JavaScript, the typeof null is 'object'. This is because in the early implementation of JavaScript, values were represented as a type tag and a value. The type tag for objects was 0. null was represented as the NULL pointer (0x00 in most platforms), which led to the typeof null returning 'object'. This behavior has been kept for backward compatibility.",

    question: "What does the 'useEffect' hook in React do?",
    options: [
      'It fetches data from the server.',
      'It lets you perform side effects in function components.',
      'It updates the state of the component.',
      'It renders the component.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "'useEffect' allows you to perform side effects in function components, like fetching data or updating the DOM. It runs after the render and can optionally clean up after itself by returning a function. This hook is essential for managing side effects such as subscriptions, timers, and logging.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the purpose of the 'Virtual DOM' in React?",
    options: [
      'It stores the HTML structure of the webpage.',
      'It optimizes updates by batching DOM changes.',
      'It allows server-side rendering.',
      'It simplifies event handling.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'The virtual DOM optimizes updates by making minimal changes to the real DOM, leading to better performance. When the state of an object changes, React first updates the virtual DOM, then compares it with a snapshot of the virtual DOM taken right before the update. This process, called "reconciliation," allows React to determine the most efficient way to update the real DOM.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const` in JavaScript?',
    options: [
      'There are no differences, they are all used for declaring variables.',
      '`let` and `const` have block scope, while `var` has function scope.',
      '`var` and `let` can be reassigned, while `const` cannot.',
      '`let` and `var` are hoisted, but `const` is not.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      '`let` and `const` have block scope, while `var` has function scope. This means that `let` and `const` are only accessible within the block they are defined in, whereas `var` is accessible within the entire function. Additionally, `const` cannot be reassigned after its initial declaration, making it useful for defining constants. `var` and `let` are hoisted to the top of their scope, but `let` and `const` are not initialized until their definition is evaluated.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What does `display: flex` do in CSS?',
    options: [
      'It hides an element.',
      'It creates a block-level container.',
      'It enables a flexible layout by aligning items within a container.',
      'It enables grid layout.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      '`display: flex` makes an element a flex container and allows for flexible layout, aligning its child items within. Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. It provides powerful alignment capabilities, such as centering items, distributing space evenly, and handling dynamic content sizes. Flexbox is particularly useful for creating responsive designs.',

      'To manage state in React components.',
      'To clean up resources in memory.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Memoization is a technique that optimizes the performance of a program by storing the results of expensive function calls. When the same inputs are encountered again, the cached result is returned rather than recalculating, making it especially useful for functions with complex calculations or large data sets.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the key features of CSS Grid?',

      'Through synchronous function calls.',
      "It doesn't support asynchronous operations.",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'JavaScript uses promises, async/await syntax, and callbacks to manage asynchronous operations. These mechanisms allow certain operations (like data fetching) to occur in the background without blocking the main thread, enabling smoother performance in the browser.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is a pure function?',

      'A function that does not return anything.',
      'A function that modifies external state.',
      'A function that returns the same output given the same input and does not have side effects.',
      'A function that can only be called once.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'A pure function is a function that consistently returns the same result given the same inputs and does not produce any side effects, such as modifying external variables or interacting with the outside world. Pure functions are a cornerstone of functional programming and lead to more predictable and testable code.',

    question: 'Which HTML5 element is used to specify a section of the document that is tangentially related to the content around it?',
    options: ['<aside>', '<section>', '<div>', '<nav>'],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'The `<aside>` element is used to define a portion of content that is related but not central to the main content of the webpage. Common use cases include sidebars, pull quotes, or advertising banners. It helps with semantic markup, improving the accessibility and readability of the HTML document.',

      'There is no difference, both are used to create space between elements.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'In CSS, margin is the space outside an element, while padding is the space between the content and the elementâ€™s border. They both control spacing but affect different parts of the box model.',
  },

      'A way to call multiple functions at once.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'A closure is a feature in JavaScript where an inner function has access to variables from its outer function even after the outer function has returned. This allows for data encapsulation and maintaining state between function calls.',

    options: ['Array', 'Set', 'Object', 'Map'],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
